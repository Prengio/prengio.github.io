A Textbook that introduces the Schr√∂dinger equation and is one of the best introductions to Quantum Mechanics. The book is easy to read(compared to others) and easy to follow. Requires some pre-requisite knowledge in complex numbers, linear algebra, proability theory and a very small amount of multivariable calculus. A Late stage further mathmetician should have the prerequisite knowledge to work through this(this was me), whilst googling concepts every once in a while.
