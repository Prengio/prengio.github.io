An olympiad book that looks over topics in olympiad maths. Topics in this book tend to be very difficult and also different from most resources available on topics (for example combinatorics with complex numbers, or solving inequalities with integrals). It ends each chapter with a selection of questions for practice with solutions found in a seperate dedicated book. From my experience this book is the one that covers the most complex content and hardest questions from all the maths olympiad books I've looked at.
